# Stallion Connect Pvt Ltd — Website (React edition)

Company website for **Stallion Connect Pvt Ltd**: call centre, BPO, sales, customer support, recruitment and back-office services.

A single-page site built with **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript**. Sections: Home, About, Services, Industries, Careers and Contact.

## Project layout

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/content.ts` | All site copy: services, industries, jobs, contact details |
| `src/components/` | One component per section, plus the looping video background and scroll reveal |
| `src/styles/fonts.css` | Instrument Serif (display) and Inter (body) |
| `src/styles/theme.css` | Colours, fonts and the `fade-rise` animations (Tailwind v4 `@theme`) |
| `src/lib/forms.ts` | Form submission and `FORM_ENDPOINT` |
| `public/` | Logos, favicon and the logo options page |

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run build` writes the production site to `dist/`.

## Deploying

Every push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds the site and publishes it to GitHub Pages. Pages serves the site from a sub-folder, so the workflow sets `BASE_PATH=/stallionconnect-aethera/`; change it there if the repository is renamed.

Without `BASE_PATH` the site builds for the domain root, which is what Vercel, Render or a custom domain need: build command `npm run build`, output folder `dist`. The workflow above is only for GitHub Pages and can be deleted if you move.

## Before launch

- **Forms** run in demo mode and send nothing. Set `FORM_ENDPOINT` in `src/lib/forms.ts` (for example a Formspree form URL) to receive enquiries and job applications by email.
- **Placeholders** are marked `TODO` in `src/content.ts` and the components: office address, phone number, social media links, the "24×7" figure, careers perks and job openings.
